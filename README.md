## About
Shravik is a GeolocationÂ based MultilingualÂ social platform for EmployersÂ and blue-collar Migrant WorkersÂ affected by the Covid 19 Pandemic built with the Flutter Framework and Dart using Firebase as database. 

It acts as a matchmaker between workers desperately looking for jobsÂ closer to their homes and potential employers who want to hireÂ them to sustain their businessÂ as their previous employees have either migrated or quit. 

Users can be searched with easy location based filters, their skill sets or skill requirements, contacted with their registered mobile number (or email) and their location is displayed on the map. 

Distance calculation between registered users is also available to help them decide in hiring or working, near the better.
